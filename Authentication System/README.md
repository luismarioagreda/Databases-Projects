#User Authentication System

*Developed a secure user authentication system using PHP, HTML, and MySQL as a part of a web application.
*Implemented user registration and login functionality, including form handling, database interactions, and session management.
*Enhanced security by hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
*Organized code effectively using reusable PHP includes, improving maintainability.
*Leveraged Bootstrap CSS to style the user interfaces.

##Some of the strong points and skills achieved in this project:
1. Database Interactions with PHP: You have demonstrated proficiency in using PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) to interact with a MySQL database. This includes establishing a connection to the database, executing SQL queries, and fetching results.
2. Form Handling in PHP: You've shown an understanding of how to handle form submissions in PHP, including capturing and handling POST data.
3. User Authentication: This system involves user registration and login functionality, which are fundamental aspects of many web applications. You've shown that you know how to hash passwords for security, a crucial aspect of user authentication.
3. Session Management: You have demonstrated the ability to create and destroy sessions in PHP, which is key to maintaining state in a stateless protocol like HTTP.
4. HTML and CSS: You have used HTML to structure the web pages and Bootstrap CSS for styling, demonstrating your front-end development skills.
5. Code Organization: Your use of the require function to include reusable PHP code (like the header and footer) shows that you understand how to organize your code effectively, which is important for maintainability.

### Authentication System
A basic user authentication system, implemented with a MySQL database (assumed from the usage of XAMPP) and sessions. This system includes three main parts: registration, login, and logout. In the registration part, new users can create an account by providing their email, username, and password. The password is hashed for security before storing in the database. In the login part, existing users can enter their email and password to access the system. If the entered details match with the database records, a new session is started, and the user is redirected to the index page. If a user is logged in and tries to access the login or register page, they are also redirected to the index page. Finally, the logout part destroys the active session and redirects the user back to the index page, effectively logging them out.

# User Authentication System

* Developed a secure user authentication system using PHP, HTML, and MySQL as a part of a web application.
* Implemented user registration and login functionality, including form handling, database interactions, and session management.
* Enhanced security by hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
* Organized code effectively using reusable PHP includes, improving maintainability.
* Leveraged Bootstrap CSS to style the user interfaces.

## Some of the strong points and skills achieved in this project:
1. Database Interactions with PHP: I have demonstrated proficiency in using PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) to interact with a MySQL database. I was responsible for establishing a connection to the database, executing SQL queries, and fetching results.
2. Form Handling in PHP: I've mastered how to handle form submissions in PHP, including capturing and handling POST data.
3. User Authentication: In this system, I implemented user registration and login functionality, which are fundamental aspects of many web applications. I learned how to hash passwords for security, a crucial aspect of user authentication.
4. Session Management: I demonstrated the ability to create and destroy sessions in PHP, a key skill for maintaining state in a stateless protocol like HTTP.
5. HTML and CSS: I used HTML to structure the web pages and Bootstrap CSS for styling, demonstrating my front-end development skills.
6. Code Organization: I used the require function to include reusable PHP code (like the header and footer) in my project, showing that I understand how to organize code effectively, an important aspect for maintainability.
